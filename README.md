This repo include the scripts i use to make [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) even better on Windows

# ðŸ”– Prerequisite

- File ( from git for mimetype) ! All is mentionned on the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/wiki/Windows-Installation-Guide)
- Wezterm for terminal image preview : [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) 
- Pwsh aka Powershell Core or you will need to replace pwsh.exe by powershell.exe on every script

# ðŸª„ Yazi Installation Script

The installation script will cover the installation of the program,
adding it to `PATH` ( allowing system to use it) and creation of a shortcut to launch it with wezterm,
_This script doesn't install the recommanded package like fzf zoxide_
The icon is created With default wezterm path from `winget` installation, if you use a portable version adjust it

## ðŸ‘· Using the script

Open powershell and run

```powershell
iex (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaysanCorrezien/Yazi-Windows/master/install.ps1' -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

** Always check script before running it from a random repo like mine **

_Maybe adding the copy of the preset from [repo](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/tree/main/yazi-config/preset) would be good_

# ðŸŒŸ Features enhancement

This repo include multiple script that offer some functionnality that are realy usefull on windows explorer :

- Open Details tab of a file
- Open powershell in current dir
- Open powershell in current dir as admin ( UAC will prompt ! )
- Drag and drop one or multiple files
- Open explorer in current working directory

And one more that i like a lot and is working perfectly for my use case :
- Open In WSLTmux , which create a session in tmux with the name of file as session name, cd into the directory of the file, and open it in Neovim 
This one is working on my `special` use case but can give you inspiration to make something that feet your need.

## How to install

Open powershell and clone the repo :
```powershell
$dirPath = "$env:APPDATA\yazi\WindowsEnhancement"; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dirPath -Force | Out-Null; git clone "https://github.com/PaysanCorrezien/Yazi-Windows.git" $dirPath
```
## Using it

To use those function we need to edit the keymap.toml file provided by the preset [here](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/tree/main/yazi-config/preset) 
On my `keymap.toml` on `$env:APPDATA\yazi\config\` , on the keymap array at the end i added :
```toml
  # Open windows Explorer in current working directory ( for features missing in yazi for now)
  	{ on = ["g", "e" ], exec = "shell 'explorer .'", desc = "Open Explorer here" },
  # Allow to drag one or multiples Files like dragon on linux. To copy in emails for example 
  # remove --confirm to check the command before running it
    { on = [ "c", "D" ], exec= '''
    shell 'pwsh.exe -ex Bypass -C "& $env:APPDATA\yazi\WindowsEnhancement\Drag.ps1 %*"' --confirm
  ''', desc= "Drag File(s)"},
  # Open the windows File explorer property Tab
    { on = [ "c", "P" ], exec= '''
    shell 'pwsh.exe -ex Bypass -C "& $env:APPDATA\yazi\WindowsEnhancement\OpenFileDetails.ps1 %1' --confirm
  ''', desc= "Open File Details"},
  # Open Powershell As User
    { on= [ "g", "p" ], exec= '''
    shell 'pwsh.exe -ex Bypass -C "& env:APPDATA\yazi\WindowsEnhancement\PowershellSession.ps1 %1 "' --confirm
  ''', desc= "Open PowerShell Here"},
  # Open Powershell As Admin / Will Prompt UAC 
  # TODO : Open in default terminal not classic powershell
  {  on= [ "g", "P" ], exec= '''
    shell 'pwsh.exe -ex Bypass -C "& $env:APPDATA\yazi\WindowsEnhancement\PowershellSession.ps1 -Admin %1 "' --confirm
  ''', desc= "Open PowerShell as Admin" },
  # Open in $EDITOR inside TMUX on WSLSIDE 
  # Create a new tmux session from filename , cd into parent folder, open it in choosen editor
  # The script OpenInWslTmux.ps1 need to be edited with name of the app 
  {  on= [ "g", "T" ], exec= '''
    shell 'pwsh.exe -ex Bypass -C "& $env:APPDATA\yazi\WindowsEnhancement\OpenInWSLTmux.ps1 %1"' --confirm
  ''', desc= "Open File In TMUX EDITOR" },
```
